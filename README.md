This project aims to create visualizations of references to concepts and impacts mentioned by caregivers of individuals with Kleefstra Syndrome (KS). In the survey interviews, caregivers referenced the ages of individuals with KS ranging from under two to 17 years old. References were counted for mentions of KS-defining concepts like motor or neurological concepts, KS individual impacts like social or health impacts, and caregiver impacts like financial or emotional impacts. The visualizations aim to help inform the effects of KS on the lived experience of the individuals and their caregivers, which can help medical health professionals prioritize intervention strategies and certain concepts at different ages.
